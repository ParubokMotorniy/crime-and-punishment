g = 5 #theft gain
l = 10 #theft loss
p = 6 #punishment
k = 5 #inspection cost
r = 10 #inspection reward

s_i = k / r #crime commitment probability, as follows from the derivative of rational inspection utility 
c_j = g / p #inspection probability, as follows from the derivative of rational crime utility
